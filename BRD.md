## 1. Project Overview

The **Business Requirements Tracker** is a web-based tool designed to capture, track, and manage business requirements throughout a project lifecycle. It simulates how business analysts gather input from stakeholders, categorize requirements, assign statuses, and ensure traceability.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

- Create a simple interface to capture structured business requirements
- Allow users to track the status of each requirement
- Display requirements in a clean, accessible list
- Provide multilingual support (starting with English & German)
- Support requirement traceability through linked fields
